Overview
The utility will be a standalone command-line application that can be run on a local machine or a server. It won't require a client-server architecture.
Components

    CLI Interface: A command-line interface built using a programming language like Python, Node.js, or Go. This will allow users to interact with the utility, providing options for backup configuration, scheduling, and storage.
    Database Connectors: Modules or libraries that enable connections to various DBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite). These connectors will facilitate backup operations.
    Backup Engine: The core component responsible for performing backups. It will utilize the database connectors to connect to the target database, execute backup commands, and handle backup file creation.
    Scheduling Mechanism: A built-in scheduler (e.g., using cron jobs on Linux/macOS or Task Scheduler on Windows) that allows users to automate backup tasks at specified intervals.
    Compression and Storage: Modules for compressing backup files and handling storage options (local and cloud). You may integrate cloud storage services like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage.
    Logging Mechanism: A logging system that records backup activities, including success/failure status, timestamps, and other relevant details.

Technical Requirements

    Programming language: Choose a language that supports CLI development and has libraries for database connections, compression, and cloud storage.
    Database connectors: Research and integrate libraries or modules for each supported DBMS.
    Scheduling library: Select a scheduling library that fits your chosen programming language.
    Cloud storage integration: Choose cloud storage services to support and integrate their APIs.
    Logging library: Select a logging library that suits your needs.

Development Roadmap

    Plan the project architecture and design.
    Choose a programming language and required libraries.
    Develop the CLI interface and backup engine.
    Integrate database connectors, scheduling, compression, and storage components.
    Implement logging and error handling mechanisms.
    Test the utility thoroughly, ensuring compatibility with various DBMS and storage options.
